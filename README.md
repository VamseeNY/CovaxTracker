## Telegram implementation
Telegram channels are accessed by the bot via a unique 'chatid'. Telegram channels can be joined via the web page available at https://vamseeny-covaxtracker-democovaxtrackerfe-mh7tnu.streamlit.app/

## Channel Automation
Three automation scripts are used to create the telegram channels, extract their ID and invite link, and link them to the bot.
